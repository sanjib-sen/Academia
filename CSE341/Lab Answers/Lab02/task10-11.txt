;Code here

; Suppose two 8-bit Signed Negative Binary Number is: 1111 1111  and  1000 0001
; As both of them are started with 1, they are negative numbers.
; Lets substract the smaller number from the larger number.

MOV AX, 10000001B
MOV BX, 11111111B
ADD AX, BX

; So we can see that the result is 0100 1100 which is a Positive
; number as it starts with 0. So, sign overflow occured.

; If we look at the flags we can see that,

; Auxiliary Flag = 1 and Carry Flag = 0
; So there is a carry into the MSB but no carry out of the MSB.
