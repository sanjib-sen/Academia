;flow occurs.

; As it started with 0, they are positive numbers.
; Lets add two of it.

MOV AX, 01111111B
MOV BX, 01111111B

; So we can see that the result is 1111 1110 which is a negative
; number as it starts with 1. So, sign overflow occured.

; If we look at the flags we can see that,

; Auxiliary Flag = 1 and Carry Flag = 0
; So there is a carry into the MSB but no carry out of the MSB.

; Suppose two 8-bit Signed Negative Binary Number is: 1111 1111  and  1000 0001
; As both of them are started with 1, they are negative numbers.
; Lets substract the smaller number from the larger number.

MOV AX, 10000001B
MOV BX, 11111111B

; So we can see that the result is 0100 1100 which is a Positive
