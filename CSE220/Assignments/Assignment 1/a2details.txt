The recursive method is useful for adding a parallel series of numbers. from 1 to upto that.
It gets a number as a parameter and return the result of the sum of 1 to that number.
For example, if we give it 5, it will return 15, because (1+2+3+4+5) = 15.

How the method works:
1. The method gets a number
2. The method saves the number for addition and calls itself by sending the previous number (number - 1) as a parameter.
3. In the second time the 2nd-time method get number-1 as a parameter and calls itself by sending the previous number (number - 2) as a parameter.
4. This happens repeatedly until the number reaches 1.
5. After the number reaches 1, the method returns a 1 to the previously called method
6. The previously called method (Suppose, it is last method - 1 /LM-1) returns the sum of its saved value (Suppose, it is SV1) +1 to the previous method(LM-2)
7. The previous method (LM-2) returns the sum of its saved value (SV2) and SV1 to its previous method (LM-3)
8. This happens repeatedly until it reaches to the method which was called at the very first.
9. Finally, the method returns the sum of the Saved value and the sum of the saved values of previously called methods.
10. Thus, we get the result of the addition.
11. As an exception, the method returns 0 if we send 0 as a parameter.
